## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The main libraries needed to run  the code are the following:   
<ul>
<li>Python 3.6.7 |Anaconda, Inc.|</li>
<li>NumPy for numerical vectorize calculations</li>
<li>Pandas for data manipulation</li>
<li>Spark</li>
<li>Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualizations</li>
</ul>


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I designed an ETL pipeline, machine learning pipeline that uses Natural
Language Processing (NLP) to analyze disaster data from [FigureEight](https://www.figure-eight.com/)
to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages.

The project includes a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get
classification results in several categories. The web app will also display visualizations of the data.

This is udacity's capstone project, using spark to analyze user behavior data from music app Sparkify.

Sparkify is a music app, this dataset contains two months of sparkify user behavior log. The log contains some basic information about the user as well as information about a single action. A user can contain many entries. In the data, a part of the user is churned, through the cancellation of the account behavior can be distinguished.

## Project Components <a name="components"></a>
**Sprakify .ipynb** Main file of the project, it demonstrates the process of using pyspark to explore the data and build the model.
